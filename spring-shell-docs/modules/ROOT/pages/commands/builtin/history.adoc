The `history` command shows the history of commands that has been executed.

There are a few configuration options that you can use to configure behavior
of a history. History is kept in a log file, which is enabled by default and can
be turned off by setting `spring.shell.command.history.enabled`. The name of a log file
is resolved from `spring.application.name` and defaults to `spring-shell.log`,
which you can change by setting `spring.shell.history.name`.

By default, a log file is generated to a current working directory, which you can dictate
by setting `spring.shell.config.location`. This property can contain
a placeholder (`+{userconfig}+`), which resolves to a common shared config directory.

TIP: Run the Spring Shell application to see how the sample application works as it uses these options.
